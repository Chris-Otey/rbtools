.. _rbt-diff:
.. program:: rbt diff

====
diff
====

:command:`rbt diff` is similar to :command:`rbt post`, but will only
print the diff to standard out instead of creating a review request
for it.

Usage::

   $ rbt diff [options] [changenum | [<file> ...]]


Default Options
===============

A number of options to :command:`rbt diff` can be set by default
in :file:`.reviewboardrc`. These can go either in the repository's
or the user's :file:`.reviewboardrc`.

The options include:

* ``DEBUG`` (:option:`-d`)
* ``REVIEWBOARD_URL`` (:option:`--server`)
* ``USERNAME`` (:option:`--username`)
* ``PASSWORD`` (:option:`--password`)
* ``REPOSITORY_TYPE`` (:option:`--repository-type`)


Options
=======

.. cmdoption:: -d, --debug

   Display debug output.

   The default can be set in ``DEBUG`` in :file:`.reviewboardrc`.

.. cmdoption:: --server

   Specify a different Review Board server to use.

   The default can be set in ``REVIEWBOARD_URL`` in :file:`.reviewboardrc`.

.. cmdoption:: --revision-range

   Generate the diff for review based on given revision range.

.. cmdoption:: --parent

   The parent branch this diff should be against (only available if your
   repository supports parent diffs).

.. cmdoption:: --tracking-branch

   Tracking branch from which your branch is derived (Git only, defaults to
   origin/master)

.. cmdoption:: --svn-changelist

   Generate the diff for review based on a local SVN changelist.

.. cmdoption:: --repository-url

   The url for a repository for creating a diff outside of a working copy
   (currently only supported by Subversion with :option:`--revision-range` or
   :option:`--diff-filename` and ClearCase with relative paths outside the
   view). For Git, this specifies the origin url of the current repository,
   overriding the origin url supplied by the Git client.

.. cmdoption:: --username

   Username to be supplied to the Review Board server.

   The default can be set in ``USERNAME`` in :file:`.reviewboardrc`.

.. cmdoption:: --repository-type

   Specifies the type of repository in the current directory. In most cases
   this should be detected automatically, but some directory structures
   containing multiple repositories require this option to select the proper
   type. The :command:`rbt list-repo-types` command can be used to list the
   supported values.

   The default can be set in ``REPOSITORY_TYPE`` in :file:`.reviewboardrc`.

.. cmdoption:: --p4-client

   The Perforce client name that the review is in.

   The default can be set in ``P4_CLIENT`` in :file:`.reviewboardrc`.

   The default can be set in ``P4_PORT`` in :file:`.reviewboardrc`.

.. cmdoption:: --p4-passwd

   The Perforce password or ticket of the user in the P4USER environment
   variable.
